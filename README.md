Welcome to the score-chasing platformer led by an innocent mushroom with a mission.

Run, jump, slide, and dash across stages as you try to gain high scores and time records.

A Game by Jodi Foster


> As my first ever Unity project, Mushy's Mission was an opportunity to learn the basics of game engines and gameplay programming. This included creating a singleton game manager for data management, basic custom scripts that handle behavior of particular game objects or UI elements, and level scenes using created and imported scripts and assets. This also taught me the basics of working with Unity's physics simulation.
